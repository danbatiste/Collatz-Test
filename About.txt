The Collatz conjecture has a pretty simple premise. Take any integer. If it's even, divide it by 2. 
If it's odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. 

Try starting with any number and repeat this process over and over again. 
Starting with 5, you'd multiply by 3 and add 1 to get 16. 
16 is even, so you'd divide it by 2 to get 8. Which leads to 4, which leads to 2, which leads to 1. 

Repeating this process, regardless of the input number, has only led to 1.
Supercomputers have tested the conjecture for all numbers, leading up to numbers with thousands of digits.

As simple as the conjecture seems, nobody has been able to mathematically prove it. 
There might be a number that leads to something other than 1. 
Or there might not be. I don't know. I think it's pretty strange. But strange is normal in math.
